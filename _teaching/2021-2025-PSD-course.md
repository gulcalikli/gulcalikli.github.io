The course, which is also taught throughout both semesters of an academic year (Fall and Spring semesters), introduces the students to modern software development methods and techniques for building and maintaining large systems. 
The course is delivered according to the Flipped Classroom Teaching Model and aims to: (1) prepare students to apply modern software development methods and techniques presented to them in the context of an extended groupbased software 
development exercise; and (2) make the students aware of the professional, social and ethical dimensions of software development. My responsibilities in this course comprise supervising âˆ¼10 project teams, marking their project artifacts 
(e.g., GitLab repositories, dissertations), and marking exam papers (course coordinator : Dr. Tim Storer).
