I am the coordinator of this graduate-level course offered mainly to the students of Information
Technology Masters Program. The course is taught over two semesters: During the Fall (first)
semester the course introduces students to the processes behind building software (e.g., Are
we building the right thing? How to manage a project), covering agile software development
practices, including Lean Software Development, Scrum and Kanban. The topics covered
during the Spring (second) semester comprise good coding practices (e.g., reducing coupling,
improving cohesion, error handling, safe classes and packages), unit testing and design patterns
(e.g., singleton, iterator, composite, creational patterns).
