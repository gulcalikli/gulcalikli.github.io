I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>, <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>, UK. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">Computer Engineering</a> from  <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US">Bo&#287;azi&ccedil;i University</a>, Istanbul. Before joining the University of Glasgow, I was a senior researcher at the <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Informatics</a>, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a> (UZH), Switzerland. Further details about my professional appointments can be found in my <a href="https://gulcalikli.github.io/files/CV_Gul_Calikli.pdf">CV</a>. My research field is empirical <b>software engineering</b> with a focus on <b>human aspects</b> (cognitive and social psychology) accompanied by Data Analytics and <b>Machine Learning</b>. My vision is to enhance software practitioners' decision-making to improve software quality by developing <b>(1)</b> tools and techniques based on cognitive psychology; and <b>(2)</b> ML systems (e.g., LLMs) with human in the loop that can be regarded as a joint cognitive system.
<p><b style="color:red;">INTERESTED IN DOING A Ph.D.?</b> I am looking for self-motivated students with <b>strong programming skills</b> (e.g., Java, Python, C++, etc.) and background in statistical analysis and <b>Machine Learning</b> (e.g., Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs). Industrial or open-source software development experience is desirable. You can read about the Ph.D. Application Process and Scholarships <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">here</a>. Usual <b>application deadline</b> is <b style="color:red;">31st January</b> every year. Feel free to <a href="mailto:handangul.calikli@glasgow.ac.uk">contact me</a> with your CV, academic transcript and publications (if any) ideally <i>1-2 months before the Ph.D. application deadline</i>, if you are interested.</p>
