I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>, <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>, United Kingdom. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">Computer Engineering</a> from  <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US">Bo&#287;azi&ccedil;i University</a>, Istanbul, Turkey. Before joining the University of Glasgow, I was a senior researcher at the <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Informatics</a>, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html">University of Zurich</a> (UZH), Switzerland. Further details about my professional appointments can be found in my <a href="https://gulcalikli.github.io/files/CV_Gul_Calikli.pdf">CV</a>. 

My research field is empirical <b>software engineering</b> with a focus on human aspects (cognitive and social psychology) accompanied by Data Analytics and Machine Learning. My broader vision is to enhance software practitioners' judgment and decision-making to improve software and development quality through the development of <b>(1)</b> tools and techniques based on cognitive psychology; and <b>(2)</b> ML systems (e.g., LLMs) with human in the loop that can be regarded as a joint cognitive system, extending human-intelligence.


Interested in doing a Ph.D.?
======
I am looking for Ph.D. self-motivated students with strong programming skills (e.g., Java, Python, C++, C#, etc.) and strong background in statistical analysis and/or Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs). Experience in industrial/open-source software development is desirable. Feel free to <a href="mailto:handangul.calikli@glasgow.ac.uk">contact me</a> with your CV, academic transcript and publications (if any) if you are interested. You can read about the <i>Ph.D. Application Process</i> and <i>Ph.D. Scholarships</i> available at University of Glasgow and the School of Computing Science <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/">here</a>. Usual <b>application deadline</b> is <b>31st January</b> every year.
